# Adafruit Calliope library

### This is a fork of Adafruit's [micro:bit library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Microbit)
The fork was modified to support the Calliope mini V3 and include an example project to show core functionalities of the Calliope mini V3.

Wrapper code and examples for using the Calliope mini with the Arduino IDE.

Included: 

  * Adafruit_GFX compatible LED Matrix driver on Timer 2
  * BLE Serial client device for talking to Adafruit Bluefruit Connect App & Adafruit IO (Based v. heavily on Sandeep Mistry's BLE Code!) (BLE only working on Calliope mini 1 & 2!)
  * Internal die temperature read (but its not very good)
